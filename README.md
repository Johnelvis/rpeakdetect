# ECG beat detection

Implements an ECG beat (acutally R-peak/QRS-complex) detection
algorithm based on the article [An Efficient R-peak Detection Based on New Nonlinear Transformation and First-Order Gaussian Differentiator](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13239-011-0065-3/fulltext.html) with some tweaks.


## Requirements

NumPy and SciPy and matplotlib if you want to use the plotting.

## Usage

The module can be run from command line. Reads newline-delimited raw
ECG sample values and takes the sampling rate in Hz as an argument. In
default mode outputs the detected peak sample numbers in the same format. Eg:

    python2 rpeakdetect.py 128 < ecg_data.csv > beat_samples.csv

With added argument `plot` plots the detection.

    python2 rpeakdetect.py 128 < ecg_data.csv
